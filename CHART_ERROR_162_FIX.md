# Chart Refresh Error 162 Fix

## Date: October 22, 2025

## Issue: False Error Messages on Chart Refresh

### Problem
When clicking the "Refresh Chart" button after changing Z-score settings, users would see alarming red ERROR messages in the Activity Log:

```
[ERROR] ðŸš¨ [ORDER ERROR] Order #999995, Code=162, Msg=Historical Market Data Service error message:API historical data query cancelled: 999995
[ERROR] Error 162: Historical Market Data Service error message:API historical data query cancelled: 999995
[WARNING] Historical data permission issue for reqId 999995: Historical Market Data Service error message:API historical data query cancelled: 999995
```

### Root Cause
When refreshing a chart:
1. The code cancels the existing historical data subscription: `self.cancelHistoricalData(999995)`
2. IBKR API sends back error code 162 to confirm the cancellation
3. Our error handler was logging this as an ERROR, even though it's expected behavior
4. The message "API historical data query cancelled" is IBKR's way of saying "OK, I cancelled it as you requested"

This is NOT an actual error - it's IBKR acknowledging our intentional cancellation.

### Fix Applied (v2 - Final)
**CRITICAL**: The check must happen BEFORE any error logging!

Updated the error handler (line 267-270) to check and suppress chart cancellation BEFORE logging:

```python
# Handle benign error codes first (before logging)
if errorCode == 10268:  # EtradeOnly attribute error
    # ... handle ...
    return

# Chart cancellation (error 162) - suppress before any logging
if errorCode == 162 and reqId in [999994, 999995] and "cancelled" in errorString.lower():
    # This is expected when we cancel a chart subscription - ignore it completely
    return

# CRITICAL: Log ALL errors for debugging order placement issues
# (Now this logging happens AFTER we've filtered out chart cancellations)
if reqId >= 1000 or errorCode not in [2104, 2106, 2158]:
    # ... log errors ...
```

### What Was Wrong in v1
The first fix checked for chart cancellations, but AFTER the error was already logged on line 279. This meant users still saw the red ERROR messages even though we were suppressing the error later.

### Fix v2 Changes
1. Moved chart cancellation check to line 267 (BEFORE any logging)
2. Removed duplicate check from line 356 (no longer needed)
3. Now errors are filtered BEFORE hitting the log, not after

### Logic
- Check if the reqId is 999994 (Trade Chart) or 999995 (Confirmation Chart)
- Check if the error message contains "cancelled"
- If both conditions are true â†’ suppress the error (return early)
- Otherwise â†’ log it as a real error

### Chart Request IDs
- **999994**: Trade Chart (bottom right panel)
- **999995**: Confirmation Chart (bottom left panel)
- **999996**: SPX underlying 1-min chart
- **999997**: VIX for Z-Score calculations
- **999998**: VIX price subscription

### Result
âœ… Chart refresh now works silently without alarming error messages  
âœ… Real historical data errors (permissions, network issues) still logged properly  
âœ… Cleaner Activity Log experience

### Testing
1. Connect to IBKR
2. Change any Z-score setting (period, threshold, EMA)
3. Click "Refresh Chart" button
4. **Before**: Red ERROR messages appear
5. **After**: Clean refresh with only success messages

### Files Modified
- **main.py** (line 267-270): Added early return for chart cancellation errors BEFORE logging
- **main.py** (line 356): Removed duplicate check (now handled earlier)

## Technical Notes

### Why Error 162 Happens
IBKR's API design pattern for modifying real-time subscriptions:
1. Client cancels existing subscription
2. Server acknowledges with error code 162 + "cancelled" message
3. Client requests new subscription with updated parameters

This is **expected behavior**, not an error condition.

### Similar Patterns in IBKR API
Other IBKR error codes that are actually "informational acknowledgments":
- **2104/2106**: Market data connection OK (we already handle these)
- **2158**: Security definition server OK (we already handle these)
- **162 + "cancelled"**: Historical data cancelled (NOW handled by this fix)

### Why Not Suppress All 162 Errors?
Error 162 can also indicate real problems:
- No market data subscription for the requested instrument
- Historical data permissions issue (common in paper trading)
- Network/connectivity problems

By checking for "cancelled" in the message, we only suppress the intentional cancellations while still catching real errors.
