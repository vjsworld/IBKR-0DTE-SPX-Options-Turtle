## üö® Important Rules for Automated Trading

### 1. Market Hours Validation
**CRITICAL**: Always check market hours before automated entry:
```python
def is_market_open():
    """Check if SPX options market is open for trading"""
    now = datetime.now(timezone('US/Eastern'))
    
    # Check if weekend
    if now.weekday() >= 5:  # Saturday=5, Sunday=6
        return False
    
    # Check if in regular trading hours (8:30 AM - 3:15 PM ET)
    time_now = now.time()
    market_open = time(8, 30)
    market_close = time(15, 15)
    
    return market_open <= time_now <= market_close
```

### 2. 0DTE Expiration Timing
- **Last trade time**: 3:15 PM ET on expiration day
- **Settlement**: P.M. settlement at 4:00 PM ET (using closing auction)
- **Exit before 3:00 PM**: Leave buffer for order fills
- **Avoid holding into close**: High risk of adverse settlement price

### 3. Volume and Liquidity Patterns
- **Peak liquidity**: 9:30 AM - 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM - 3:15 PM
- **Lunch lull**: 11:30 AM - 1:30 PM (lower volume)
- **0DTE spike**: Final 30 minutes (3:00 PM - 3:15 PM) sees huge volume

## üìä Comparison: SPX vs XSP for Our Application

| Factor | SPX/SPXW | XSP (Mini) | Recommendation |
|--------|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Capital Required** | ~$410k notional | ~$41k notional | XSP for smaller accounts |
| **Liquidity** | Highest (most active) | Good but lower | SPX for fastest fills |
| **Commissions** | $0.70-$2.51 | $0.31-$0.60 | XSP cheaper per contract |
| **Bid-Ask Spread** | Tightest | Slightly wider | SPX for best pricing |
| **Position Sizing** | Large increments | Granular (10x more flexible) | **XSP WINNER** |
| **0DTE Availability** | ‚úÖ Every day (SPXW) | ‚úÖ Mon/Tue/Wed/Thu/Fri | Both excellent |
| **Settlement** | A.M. (SPX) / P.M. (SPXW) | P.M. | SPXW/XSP better for 0DTE |

### **Recommendation for This Application**:
**Use XSP** for most strategies because:
1. ‚úÖ More flexible position sizing (1/10th size allows 10x granularity)
2. ‚úÖ Lower capital requirements (better for smaller accounts)
3. ‚úÖ Lower commissions per contract
4. ‚úÖ Daily expirations (Mon-Fri)
5. ‚úÖ P.M. settlement (better for 0DTE exit timing)
6. ‚úÖ Same tax benefits (60/40 treatment)

**Use SPX/SPXW only if**:
- Very large account (>$500k)
- Need absolute tightest spreads
- Trading size where XSP requires too many contracts
