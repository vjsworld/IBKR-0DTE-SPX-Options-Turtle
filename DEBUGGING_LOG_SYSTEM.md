# Comprehensive Logging & Debugging System

## Date: October 21, 2025

## Problem
SPX 0DTE options orders are not appearing in TWS Order Management window despite:
- ‚úÖ Successful API connection
- ‚úÖ Market data flowing correctly
- ‚úÖ placeOrder() API call completing without exceptions
- ‚ùå No callbacks from TWS (no openOrder, no orderStatus)

## Changes Implemented

### 1. File Logging System
**Location**: `logs/` folder
**Filename Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD.txt` (e.g., `2025-10-21.txt`)
**Features**:
- Automatic daily log file creation
- Timestamped entries: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] [LEVEL] message`
- Vertical arrangement (one entry per line)
- All GUI logs also written to file
- Persistent across sessions

**Files Modified**:
- Added `import logging` to imports
- Created `setup_file_logger()` function
- Updated `log_message()` to write to file and GUI

### 2. Order Placement Fixes
**Removed**: `order.auxPrice = 0` line that was potentially causing silent rejections
**Added**: Comprehensive contract validation before placing orders

### 3. Enhanced Diagnostics
- Contract field validation (checks all required fields)
- Detailed object inspection (logs all contract and order attributes)
- 3-second timeout warning if no callbacks received
- Special üö® highlighting for order-related errors

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Restart Application
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe main.py
```

### Step 2: Place Test Order
1. Wait for connection
2. Wait for market data to load
3. Click **BUY CALL** button
4. Watch activity log carefully

### Step 3: Check Log File
```powershell
cat logs\2025-10-21.txt
```

Look for:
- `=== PLACING ORDER #X ===`
- `CONTRACT DETAILS` section
- `ORDER DETAILS` section
- Any validation errors
- Callback messages (or lack thereof)

## What to Look For in Logs

### Success Pattern (order accepted):
```
[14:03:05] [INFO] === PLACING ORDER #5 ===
[14:03:05] [INFO] Contract: SPX 6765C 20251022
[14:03:05] [INFO] TradingClass: SPXW
[14:03:05] [INFO] ‚úì Contract validation passed
[14:03:05] [INFO] ‚úì placeOrder() API call completed
[14:03:05] [SUCCESS] ‚úì‚úì‚úì TWS RECEIVED Order #5 ‚úì‚úì‚úì  <-- THIS IS WHAT WE WANT!
[14:03:05] [INFO] Order 5: PreSubmitted - Filled: 0 @ 0
```

### Failure Pattern (current state):
```
[14:03:05] [INFO] === PLACING ORDER #5 ===
[14:03:05] [INFO] Contract: SPX 6765C 20251022
[14:03:05] [INFO] TradingClass: SPXW
[14:03:05] [INFO] ‚úì Contract validation passed
[14:03:05] [INFO] ‚úì placeOrder() API call completed
[14:03:08] [WARNING] ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: No callbacks received for order #5 after 3 seconds
```

## Known Issues Being Investigated

### 1. Silent Rejection by TWS
**Possible Causes**:
- Order precautions not fully bypassed
- Trading permissions issue
- Contract format subtly incorrect
- Order object field issue

### 2. Diagnostic Questions
- [ ] What does TWS Messages window show?
- [ ] Are there ANY orders in TWS Order Management (even rejected)?
- [ ] What happens with a simple stock order (e.g., AAPL)?
- [ ] Does TWS API show as "connected" in TWS interface?

## Next Steps

1. **Review Log File**: Check `logs/2025-10-21.txt` for complete order details
2. **TWS Messages**: Screenshot any errors in TWS Messages window
3. **TWS Order Management**: Screenshot showing no orders
4. **Test Simple Order**: Try placing an AAPL stock order to verify API works
5. **Review Contract Details**: Compare logged contract with IBKR documentation
