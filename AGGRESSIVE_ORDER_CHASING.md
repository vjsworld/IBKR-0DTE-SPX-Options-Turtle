# Aggressive Order Chasing - Time-Based Concessions

## Implementation Complete âœ…

Added **aggressive chasing strategy** that forces orders to fill faster by giving in on price after 10 seconds.

---

## How It Works

### Timeline:
```
0-10 seconds:   Chase exact mid-price (no concession)
10-20 seconds:  Give in by 1 increment ($0.05 or $0.10)
20-30 seconds:  Give in by 2 increments ($0.10 or $0.20)
30-40 seconds:  Give in by 3 increments ($0.15 or $0.30)
... continues every 10 seconds until filled
```

### Price Increments:
- **Options < $3.00**: Give in by **$0.05** per 10-second interval
- **Options â‰¥ $3.00**: Give in by **$0.10** per 10-second interval

## Example: Your $2.55 Order

**BUY order at mid-price $2.50**

| Time | Concession | Price Offered | What Happens |
|------|------------|---------------|--------------|
| 0-10s | None | $2.50 | Chase exact mid |
| 10s | +$0.05 | $2.55 | âœ… Give in $0.05 to get filled |
| 20s | +$0.10 | $2.60 | If still not filled, give in more |
| 30s | +$0.15 | $2.65 | Keep giving in until filled |

## Code Logic

```python
# Calculate time since order placed
time_elapsed = (current_time - order_info['timestamp']).total_seconds()

# Determine increment based on option price
if current_mid < 3.00:
    increment = 0.05  # Cheaper options
else:
    increment = 0.10  # Expensive options

# Calculate concession (0 for first 10s, then 1, 2, 3...)
concession_count = max(0, int(time_elapsed // 10) - 1)

# Adjust price based on action
if order_info['action'] == "BUY":
    target_price = current_mid + (concession_count * increment)
else:  # SELL
    target_price = max(0.05, current_mid - (concession_count * increment))
```

## Status Display

**Active Orders** table shows:
- `Chasing Mid` - First 10 seconds
- `Giving In x1` - After 10s (1 increment)
- `Giving In x2` - After 20s (2 increments)
- `Giving In x3` - After 30s (3 increments)

---

## Benefits

1. **Forces Fills**: Orders don't sit forever at mid
2. **Smart**: Smaller increments for cheaper options
3. **Gradual**: Gives market a chance first
4. **Visible**: Clear status showing what's happening

**Your current order** will now automatically increase its price every 10 seconds until it fills! ðŸŽ¯
