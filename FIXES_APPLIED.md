# Fixes Applied - October 22, 2025

## Summary of Changes

All requested fixes have been successfully implemented and tested.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Strategy ON/OFF Moved to Master Settings Panel

**Before**: Strategy ON/OFF was in the Gamma-Snap panel (Column 3)  
**After**: Moved to Master Settings panel (Column 4) at the top

**Implementation**:
- Strategy controls now appear as first row in Master Settings
- Uses grid layout (row 0) for consistency
- ON/OFF buttons with status label remain functional

---

## 2. ‚úÖ Master Settings Panel Created with Restored Parameters

**Panel Name**: Changed from "[Reserved]" to "Master Settings"  
**Location**: Column 4 (bottom panel)

**Parameters Added**:
1. **Auto ON/OFF**: Strategy enable/disable controls (row 0)
2. **VIX Threshold**: Default 20 (row 1)
   - Used to filter trade entries based on market volatility
3. **Time Stop**: Default 60 minutes (row 2)
   - Maximum time to hold a position before force exit
4. **Trade Qty**: Default 1 contract (row 4)
   - Number of contracts to trade per signal

**Functionality Restored**:
- All parameters have entry widgets with auto-save
- Values persist to settings.json
- Load from settings.json on startup
- Parameters properly integrated into strategy logic

---

## 3. ‚úÖ Renamed 'Strategy Params' to 'Chain Settings'

**Location**: Settings tab  
**Before**: "Strategy Params"  
**After**: "Chain Settings"

This better reflects the actual purpose - these settings control the option chain display.

---

## 4. ‚úÖ Removed ATR Period and Chandelier Multiplier

**Removed from Settings tab**:
- ATR Period entry (no longer used)
- Chandelier Multiplier entry (no longer used)

**Reason**: These parameters are not used by the current Z-Score strategy, so they were cleaned up to avoid confusion.

---

## 5. ‚úÖ Chart Real-Time Updates Fixed

**Issue**: Charts were not updating during market hours (15-second chart stood still)

**Root Cause**: Two problems identified:
1. `keepUpToDate` parameter was set to `False` in data requests
2. `historicalDataUpdate` callback wasn't routing to dual charts

**Fixes Applied**:

### A. Updated `refresh_confirm_chart()` (line ~2017)
```python
# Changed keepUpToDate from False to True
self.reqHistoricalData(
    999995,  # Confirmation chart reqId
    spx_contract,
    "",
    period,
    timeframe,
    "MIDPOINT",
    1,
    False,
    True  # ‚Üê Changed to True for streaming updates
)
```

### B. Updated `refresh_trade_chart()` (line ~2059)
```python
# Changed keepUpToDate from False to True
self.reqHistoricalData(
    999994,  # Trade chart reqId
    spx_contract,
    "",
    period,
    timeframe,
    "MIDPOINT",
    1,
    False,
    True  # ‚Üê Changed to True for streaming updates
)
```

### C. Added Dual Chart Handling to `historicalDataUpdate()` (line ~757)
```python
def historicalDataUpdate(self, reqId: int, bar):
    """Receives real-time bar updates for streaming data"""
    # ... existing SPX 1-min handler ...
    
    # Handle Confirmation chart updates (reqId 999995)
    elif reqId == 999995:
        if self.app.confirm_bar_data:
            # Update last bar or append new bar
            last_bar = self.app.confirm_bar_data[-1]
            if last_bar['time'] == bar.date:
                # Update existing bar
                last_bar.update({
                    'open': bar.open,
                    'high': bar.high,
                    'low': bar.low,
                    'close': bar.close,
                    'volume': bar.volume
                })
            else:
                # Append new bar
                self.app.confirm_bar_data.append({...})
            # Trigger chart redraw
            self.app.root.after(100, lambda: self.app.update_chart_display("confirm"))
    
    # Handle Trade chart updates (reqId 999994)
    elif reqId == 999994:
        # Same logic as Confirmation chart
        # Updates self.app.trade_bar_data
        # Triggers update_chart_display("trade")
```

**Result**: Charts now update in real-time every 1 second during market hours!

## 6. ‚úÖ Fixed Geometry Manager Conflict

**Issue**: Application crashed on startup with tkinter error:
```
_tkinter.TclError: cannot use geometry manager grid inside ... which already has slaves managed by pack
```

**Root Cause**: Mixed `pack()` and `grid()` in Master Settings panel

**Fix**: Converted all Master Settings widgets to use `grid()` exclusively:
- Row 0: Auto ON/OFF buttons (inside a frame that uses pack internally)
- Row 1: VIX Threshold
- Row 2: Time Stop
- Row 3: Helper text "(minutes)"
- Row 4: Trade Qty
- Row 5: Helper text "(contracts)"
