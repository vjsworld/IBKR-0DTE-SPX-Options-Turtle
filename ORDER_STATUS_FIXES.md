# Order Status & Display Fixes

**Date**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Removed 3-Second Warning Check
**Problem**: After verifying orders work correctly, the 3-second timeout warning was no longer needed and cluttered the activity log.

**Location**: Line ~3487 in `place_manual_order()`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed timeout check callback (`check_order_callback()`)
- ✅ Removed verbose logging messages about expected callbacks
- ✅ Simplified to single success message: "✓ Order #{order_id} placed successfully"

**Before**:
```python
self.log_message(f"✓ placeOrder() API call completed for order #{order_id}", "SUCCESS")
self.log_message(f"⏳ Waiting for TWS callbacks...", "INFO")
self.log_message(f"   Expected callbacks:", "INFO")
self.log_message(f"   1. orderStatus() with status 'PreSubmitted' or 'Submitted'", "INFO")
self.log_message(f"   2. openOrder() with full order details", "INFO")
self.log_message(f"   If no callbacks within 3 seconds, check TWS Order Management window", "WARNING")

# Schedule a timeout check
if self.root:
    def check_order_callback():
        if order_id in self.pending_orders:
            self.log_message(f"⚠️ WARNING: No callbacks received for order #{order_id} after 3 seconds", "WARNING")
            # ... more warning messages
    self.root.after(3000, check_order_callback)
```

**After**:
```python
self.placeOrder(order_id, contract, order)
self.log_message(f"✓ Order #{order_id} placed successfully", "SUCCESS")
```

### Issue 2: Orders Disappearing Prematurely from Active Orders Grid

**Problem**: Orders were being removed from the "Active Orders" grid as soon as they received "Submitted" status, even though they weren't filled yet. This made it impossible to see working orders.

**Root Cause**: Misunderstanding of IBKR order status values:
- **"PreSubmitted"** = Order received by TWS, not yet at exchange
- **"Submitted"** = Order accepted by exchange, **WAITING TO BE FILLED** ⚠️
- **"Filled"** = Order completely executed
- **"Cancelled"** = Order cancelled by user/system
- **"Inactive"** = Order rejected (invalid, exchange closed, etc.)

**Location**: Line ~4933 in `update_order_in_tree()`

**Changes**:
- ✅ Removed "Submitted" from the list of statuses that remove orders from grid
- ✅ Added clarifying comment explaining the difference
- ✅ Orders now stay visible while "PreSubmitted" or "Submitted" (working states)
- ✅ Orders only removed when "Filled", "Cancelled", or "Inactive" (terminal states)

**Before**:
```python
# If filled/cancelled/submitted/inactive, remove the row
if status in ["Filled", "Cancelled", "Submitted", "Inactive"]:  # ❌ WRONG!
    data.pop(i)
    # ...
```

**After**:
```python
# Only remove order when actually filled or cancelled
# "PreSubmitted" and "Submitted" mean order is working, NOT filled!
# "Inactive" means rejected (exchange closed, invalid order, etc.)
if status in ["Filled", "Cancelled", "Inactive"]:  # ✅ CORRECT!
    data.pop(i)
    # ...
```

## IBKR Order Status Flow

Understanding the complete order lifecycle:

```
placeOrder() called
    ↓
"PreSubmitted" → Order received by TWS
    ↓
"Submitted" → Order sent to exchange, WORKING (visible in Active Orders)
    ↓
    ├─→ "Filled" → Order executed (removed from Active Orders)
    ├─→ "Cancelled" → Order cancelled (removed from Active Orders)
    └─→ "Inactive" → Order rejected (removed from Active Orders)
```

**Key Insight**: "Submitted" does NOT mean filled! It means the order is actively working on the exchange, waiting to be matched. This is especially important for limit orders that may take time to fill.

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Verify syntax (no errors)
- [ ] Place manual order (BUY CALL/PUT)
- [ ] Confirm order appears in Active Orders grid with "PreSubmitted" status
- [ ] Confirm order updates to "Submitted" status (and STAYS visible)
- [ ] Confirm order updates to "Filled" status (and is removed)
- [ ] Confirm no 3-second warning messages appear in Activity Log
- [ ] Test order cancellation (should remove from grid)
- [ ] Test invalid order (should show "Inactive" then remove)

## User Experience Improvements

**Activity Log**:
- ✅ Cleaner output without verbose callback expectations
- ✅ No false warnings after successful order placement
- ✅ Focus on actual order state changes

**Active Orders Grid**:
- ✅ Orders remain visible while working (PreSubmitted/Submitted)
- ✅ Users can see pending orders and their status
- ✅ Orders only disappear when truly complete (Filled/Cancelled)
- ✅ Clear distinction between "order accepted" vs "order filled"

---

## Code Quality

- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ No type checking errors
- ✅ Proper IBKR API status handling
- ✅ Clear inline comments explaining status meanings
- ✅ Simplified code (removed unnecessary timeout check)

**Lines Changed**: ~30 lines (2 functions)
**Files Modified**: `main.py`
**Net Result**: Cleaner UI, correct order tracking, better UX
